The walls are not papered or painted, but hung with immense, antique mirrors whose reflections are stubbornly independent; one shows you as you are, another as a child clutching a lost toy, and a third reflects a figure cloaked in shadow, its face tantalizingly obscured. A grand, sweeping staircase of pale, almost translucent marble dominates the space, its balustrade carved into a procession of unknown beasts, but it offers no single destination. Instead, its steps branch and diverge, leading up into swirling mists of pearlescent light or descending into pools of quiet shadow, each path seeming to hum with a different, silent song.
