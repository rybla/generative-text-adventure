The very air hums with a strange, static-like energy, a sense that the house itself is a puzzle box, and the player is the key, the trespasser, and the prize all at once.

No treasure hunter, he arrived with only a worn journal and a steady hand, treating each new impossibility not as a threat, but as a verse in the house's incoherent poem. Patient and analytical, he seeks the rhythm of the Manor's chaotic heart, believing that in mapping it, he will find not only the legendary Still Room but the fragmented path of his own past.\"},\"rooms\":[{\"name\":\"Main Foyer\",\"description\":\"In the Foyer, nothing is constant. The obsidian floor shifts from darkness to the light of alien stars. The mirrored walls show not just you, but your childhood and a future shrouded in shadow. From a grand staircase of pale marble, carved with a procession of strange beasts, infinite paths diverge into mist and shadow. The air itself is a live wire, crackling with the twin promises of welcome and warning.\"},{\"name\":\"Grand Hallway\",\"description\":\"The Grand Hallway is an expansive and breathtaking space, its walls adorned with intricate tapestries depicting ancient battles and celestial events. Sunlight streams through a massive stained-glass window at one end, casting kaleidoscopic patterns across the polished marble floor. Suits of ancient armor stand sentinel along the corridor, their empty visors seeming to watch your every move. The air is still and carries a faint scent of aged parchment and something indefinable, perhaps magic itself. This is a place of passage, a nexus from which many paths diverge.\"},{\"name\":\"Obsidian Chamber\",\"description\":\"The Obsidian Chamber is a cavernous space where the very air seems to hum with a latent power. The walls are composed of polished obsidian, reflecting distorted images of the room and any who enter. Crystalline formations of pure darkness jut from the floor and ceiling, absorbing all light and casting deep, impenetrable shadows. In the center of the chamber, a single, massive obsidian pillar stands, its surface eerily smooth and cool to the touch. Strange, faint glyphs are etched into its base, glowing with a faint, internal luminescence.\"}],\"items\":[{\"name\":\"Welcome Note\",\"description\":\"Welcome to the Shifting Manor!
