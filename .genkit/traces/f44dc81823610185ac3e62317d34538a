A grand, sweeping staircase of pale, almost translucent marble dominates the space, its balustrade carved into a procession of unknown beasts, but it offers no single destination. Instead, its steps branch and diverge, leading up into swirling mists of pearlescent light or descending into pools of quiet shadow, each path seeming to hum with a different, silent song.
