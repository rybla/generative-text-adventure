Sunlight streams through a massive stained-glass window at one end, casting kaleidoscopic patterns across the polished marble floor. Suits of ancient armor stand sentinel along the corridor, their empty visors seeming to watch your every move. The air is still and carries a faint scent of aged parchment and something indefinable, perhaps magic itself. This is a place of passage, a nexus from which many paths diverge.\"},{\"name\":\"Obsidian Chamber\",\"description\":\"The Obsidian Chamber is a cavernous space where the very air seems to hum with a latent power. The walls are composed of polished obsidian, reflecting distorted images of the room and any who enter. Crystalline formations of pure darkness jut from the floor and ceiling, absorbing all light and casting deep, impenetrable shadows. In the center of the chamber, a single, massive obsidian pillar stands, its surface eerily smooth and cool to the touch.
